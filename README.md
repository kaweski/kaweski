### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natasha Isadora Kaweski Leite, but you can call me Isa or Nat. âœ¨

I live in Brazil and I have a Computer Scientist graduation since 2020.

I use to be Front-end Developer since 2012 when I was having Graphic Computer classes and started working in an agency in Belo Horizonte-MG.
I started my career with agencies, but since middle 2017 I work in financial products.
Today I'm working as Design System Ops, and I'm really enjoying this new experience! âœ¨

Keep your feet on the ground.
