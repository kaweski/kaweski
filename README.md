### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natasha Isadora Kaweski Leite, but you can call me Isa or Nat. âœ¨

I live in Brazil and I have a Computer Scientist graduation since 2020.

I use to be Front-end Developer since 2012 when I was having Graphic Computer classes and started working in an agency in Belo Horizonte-MG.
I started my career with agencies, but since middle 2017 I work in financial products.
Today I'm working as Senior Design System Ops, and I'm really enjoying this new experience! âœ¨

Some facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my website http://kawe.ski
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Redux + Typescript.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Design System!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: chat only :) I'm not freelancing.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be Front-end but today I work as Design System Ops, but, actually the fun fact is that I'm returning to programing. This is pretty difficult! Need to practice more.
