### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isadora Kaweski, but you can call me Isa. âœ¨

I live in Brazil and I'm 29 years old.
I still study Computer Science and I graduate at the end of this year.

I'm a Front-end Developer since 2012 when I was having Graphic Computer classes and started working in an agency in Belo Horizonte-MG.
I started my career with agencies, but since middle 2017 I work in financial products.
Today I work in a Bank using React/Javascript.

To be more precise:

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on product for legal entities (we call it "pessoa jurÃ­dica" in Brazil).
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m learning about UX/UI. âœ¨

Keep your feet on the ground.
