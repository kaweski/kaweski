### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isadora Kaweski, but you can call me Isa. âœ¨
(Some friends still call me Natasha ~~because it's my first name~~ but I don't like it. So, call me Isa ðŸ˜„).

I live in Brazil and I'm 29 years old.
I still study Computer Science (as you can see I have a lot of Java and C repositories just because of that), but I graduate at the end of this year.

I'm a Front-end Developer since 2012 when I was having Graphic Computer classes and started working in an agency in Belo Horizonte-MG.
I started my career with agancies, but since middle 2017 I work in financial products. I loved work with financial product and I prefer to work with MONEY! Hahaha Just kidding...

Today I work in a Bank and I use Javascript and CSS as my work tools.

To be more precise:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on product for legal entities (we call it PJ - pessoa jurÃ­dica - in Brazil).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more of React and other Javascript frameworks, also reading a lot for my CBT. I'm also learning UX/UI and enjoying a lot! âœ¨
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently enjoying this quarantine playing a lot of The Sims 4 (Origin account: kaweskisa) and World of Warcraft (Blizzard account: naweskil) ðŸ˜Š.
- ðŸ¤” Oh! Before quarantine I was studying a way to create a RPG platform, to help masters to organize their table. If you want to help, please reach me!

Keep your feet on the ground.
